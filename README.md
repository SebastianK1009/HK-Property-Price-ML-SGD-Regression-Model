Project Overview
This project leverages various property attributes such as location, size, age, and other factors to predict the selling price of properties in Hong Kong. With a well-trained machine learning model, the goal is to help real estate investors assess potential profits based on historical transaction data.

Data Overview
The dataset includes the following features:

Location Data: District and estate name in Hong Kong.
Property Specifications: Size (square footage), floor level, and other structural details.
Financial Information: Selling price, profit/loss flags, and calculated price per area.
Transaction Timing: Sale date, holding time, and other temporal data.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd hong_kong_property_price_prediction
Install required dependencies: Ensure that Python 3.x is installed, then run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dependencies include packages such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

Usage
Data Preparation:

Load the dataset cleaned_data.csv and apply any necessary preprocessing steps.
Training the Model:

Use the notebook to run the Train-Test Validation Split, Model Implementation, and Hyperparameter Tuning sections.
Prediction:

Use the final model to predict property prices based on user-input features.
Model Details
This project implements machine learning techniques including:

Feature Engineering: Adjust and create meaningful features from the raw data.
Model Training: Trains a machine learning model on historical data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes model parameters for better prediction accuracy.
Results
The final model's performance metrics are evaluated using validation data. Performance indicators and potential visualizations of the model's effectiveness are provided in the notebook.
